An high interest was expressed for the following projects. Some work was already been completed and we are looking to have an official team lead for it.

### React variant

### Angular

Need for more documentation on how WET can be integrated with Angular. For instruction on how pages can be designed to ensure the "Basic HTML mode" continue to work as expected. For instruction on how to design web interface that support Basic HTML and the angular enhanced mode.

* [Github wet-boew issue #8206](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/8206)

### Compare product

To have an easy way to compare multiple product side by side. A feature similar as we can found when a user want to buy a new camera on a web site and he want to compare side by side the specification for two different model of camera in order to decide which one would fit best his needs.
