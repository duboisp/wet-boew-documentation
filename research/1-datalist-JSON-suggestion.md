## Similar tools

Here a list of similar tools that was found on a February 2018 research


* [jQuery accessible autocomplete list (with some ARIA)](https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/autocomplete-list/)
	* The UI and the interaction pattern is interesting and seems to address some of the requirement.
	* It don't support loading suggestion from a JSON file.
	* The javascript code don't seems to be optimized, there is a lot of repeative code.
	* The solution simulate the "suggestion" panel, more testing need to be done.
